# Tech Support Simulator
A tech support simulator. Wouldn't use it for training myself, but with some changes, you could train tech support workers with this thing! (Warning: When you push, we will build, and push the new source code. Please pull until you get a new binary after you push.)
# Install
Tech Support Simulator is very portable. If you have write acess, you can use this!
To install it, type in
git clone https://github.com/TechyTommy3/Tech-Support-Simulator.git
and then to run it, type in
cd dist
techsupport
The dist folder contains the latest playable version.
# Build
Good news. We have the build system on autopilot. Just pull the latest version and run techsupport.exe!
